## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Breaking Changes

- `@verino/core` — `OTPState` type has been removed. Replace all references with `OTPStateSnapshot`.
- `@verino/core` — `otp.state` now returns a new isolated snapshot on every read instead of a shared mutable reference. Code that cached `const s = otp.state` and expected it to reflect subsequent mutations will break — read `otp.state` fresh on each access, or use `otp.subscribe` to react to changes.
- All adapters — `onTick` now fires immediately on mount and after every `reset()` with the full remaining seconds, not only on each decrement. Remove any code that manually sets the initial timer display — the first `onTick` call handles it.

### Added

- `@verino/core` — `@verino/core/toolkit` subpath export; provides `triggerHapticFeedback`, `triggerSoundFeedback`, `createResendTimer`, password-manager badge helpers, and shared input controller primitives for building custom adapters.
- `@verino/core` — `createTimer` accepts `emitInitialTickOnStart` and `emitInitialTickOnRestart` boolean options. When enabled, `onTick` fires synchronously on `start()` and `restart()` with the full `totalSeconds` — eliminating the one-second blank delay at timer start.
- `@verino/react` — `resend()` method on `UseOTPResult`; clears the field, restarts the timer, and fires `onResend`. Accepts `onResend` callback in `ReactOTPOptions`.
- `@verino/vue` — `resend()` method on `UseOTPResult`; accepts `onResend` in `VueOTPOptions`.
- `@verino/svelte` — `resend()` method on `UseOTPResult`; accepts `onResend` in `SvelteOTPOptions`.
- `@verino/web-component` — `resend()` DOM method; `id-base` HTML attribute for setting a deterministic ID prefix on SSR-rendered pages.

### Fixed

- `@verino/core` — `parseSeparatorAfter` accepted `0` as a valid separator index on the single-value path, producing a separator before the first slot. Now consistently rejects any value less than `1`, matching the array path behaviour.
- `@verino/core` — Duplicate `idBase` values across simultaneously mounted instances now log a warning in development, preventing silent ARIA ID collisions.
- `@verino/vanilla` — Calling `initOTP` on an element that already has a live instance now destroys the stale instance before mounting the new one, instead of silently leaving the old listeners and plugins active.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-01

Initial release.

### Added

- `useOTP(options)` hook — creates and manages a `createOTP` instance that is stable across re-renders; returns state, pre-composed props, and control methods.
- `HiddenOTPInput` — `forwardRef` component for the zero-opacity hidden input that overlays the slot row; applies absolute-positioning styles automatically.
- `getSlotProps(index)` — per-slot render props including `hasFakeCaret` for rendering a blinking cursor on the active, empty, focused slot.
- `getInputProps(index)` — slot `data-*` attributes with `data-focus` injected from adapter state, ready to spread onto slot divs.
- Callback stability — `onComplete`, `onExpire`, `onResend`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `onInvalidChar`, `onChange`, `pasteTransformer`, and `pattern` are stored in refs; safe to pass inline functions without restarting subscriptions.
- Controlled value via `value?: string` — programmatic fills sync without triggering `onComplete`.
- `onChange` fires once per interaction batch; suppressed during controlled value sync and `defaultValue` application.
- `timerSeconds` — live countdown state; restarts automatically when `reset()` or `resend()` is called.
